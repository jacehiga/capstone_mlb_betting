# Capstone Project - MLB Betting

This repository showcases my Capstone project, where I built custom scrapers to collect MLB data, combined it with domain research, and applied statistical analysis and machine learning to generate actionable insights. I also created an interactive dashboard to visualize trends and model outputs for easier interpretation.
